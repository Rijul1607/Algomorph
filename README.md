# 🧠 AlgoMorph – Interactive Algorithm Visualizer

**AlgoMorph** is a web-based platform that brings algorithms and data structures to life through animated, real-time visualizations and interactive controls.  
It allows users to step through code logic, visualize pointer movements, manipulate data live, and gain deep insights into how things work under the hood.

> _“From code to concept, one morph at a time.”_
